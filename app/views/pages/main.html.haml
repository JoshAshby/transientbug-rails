%h2.ui.header transientBug
%p
  transientBug offers basic bookmark functionality, akin to pocket, pinboard, delicious and others, but with a few benifits:
  %ul.list
    %li
      %b Cheap
      If it works out well I might look into some low cost plans, but for now its free.
    %li
      %b Simple
      It should be featurefull and advanced where applicable, but the interface should try to remain as simple as I can make it (This is a work in progress).
    %li
      %b No Tracking
      This might be shocking, if you know me in real life as I work on an analytics team, but I don't want to be tracking every movement around the site that a user makes. No tracking or ads. Ever.
      Currently there is still a font loaded from google, but once I find a replacement for it that I like, there won't be any third party scripts, styles, fonts or other loaded.
    %li
      %b Hard Deletes
      Going with the above point, if you delete a bookmark, its
      %u gone
      and is not going to come back out of the blue.
